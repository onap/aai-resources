      "message": "I think a better approach for this would be to implement this as an interceptor.\nThat way the validation could be applied to *all* requests without affecting the business logic of these controllers.\nYou can find examples of other interceptors in `interceptors.pre`.\n\nI would also suggest to introduce some `aai.request.encodingvalidation.enabled` property to be able to toggle this on and off.\nI could imagine that this kind of char decoding that you are doing in the UTF8Validator is quite expensive performance-wise.",
