#
# The settings in this file control the behavior of the CSM Framework. 
# The majority of the settings in this file adhere to the following
# pattern:
# 
#  [EntityType].[EntityId].[PropertyName]=[PropertyValue]
# 
# Where:
# 
#  [EntityType]    Identifies the type of entity (service or
#                  service group) that's being configured.
#  [EntityId]      Identifies the individual entity.
#  [PropertyName]  Identifies the property that is being set.
#  [PropertyValue] Is the actual property value.
# 
# In the formatting sample above, the EntityType can be setto one of the
# following values:
# 
#  * 'Service' if an individual service is being configured.
#  * 'Group 'if a service group is being configured.
# 
# The reference to 'entity' in the above description is intentionally
# generic.  The CSM Framework supports the configuration of individual
# services as well as groups of services.  The type of entity that is
# actually being configured is determined by the value of the
# [EntityType] portion of the property.
# 
# There are two values for [EntityId] that have a special meaning within
# the CSM Framework:
# 
# 
# DefaultService - Identifies the default configuration for any service
#     that is not explicitly configured elsewhere in this file.
# 
# DefaultServiceGroup - This identifies the entity that provides the
#     default configuration for any service group that is not explicitly
#     configured elsewhere in this file.
# 
# DO NOT use either of these as the identifier for any of your
# application-specific services or service groups.
# 
# The CSM Framework treats all entity identifiers in a case-insensitive
# manner.  The entity ids 'Service1' and 'SERVICE1' are equivalant.  All
# properties with the same [EntityId] will be applied to the same
# configuration.  The CSM Framework framework also treats property names
# in a case-insensitive manner.  'MaxRequestCount' and 'MAXREQUESTCOUNT'
# are considered equivalent within the CSM framework.
# 
# The following properties are supported by the CSM Framework.  Any
# properties that are entity-specific will include the '[EntityId].'
# prefix.
# 
# [EntityType].[EntityId].Enabled - Indicates if the entity is enabled
#     or disabled by default.  The value of this property must be either
#     'true' or 'false'.
# 
# [EntityType].[EntityId].MaxRequestCount - The maximum number of
#     requests that can be running at any point in time.  Once this limit is
#     reached, the service is considered  to be 'flooded', and subsequent
#     requests are refused until the request count drops to the level
#     specified by the RestartThreshold property.  Once the restart
#     threshold is reached, the service will be 'restarted' based on the
#     values of the 'RestartFrequency' and 'RestartIncrement' properties.
#     The value of this property must be a numeric value.
#     The default value for this property is 20.
# 
# [EntityType].[EntityId].MaxStalledRequestCount - the maximum number of
#     'stalled' requests that are allowed before subsequent requests are
#     refused
#     The value of this property must be a numeric value.
#     The default value for this property is 10.
# 
# [EntityType].[EntityId].RestartThreshold - the process count level at
#     which requests will be allowed to proceed whenever a service becomes
#     'flooded'.  This property is only used if the total process count
#     reaches the level set by the 'MaxRequestCount' property.  Once that
#     occurs, subsequent requests will be refused until the active request
#     count drops to the level specified by this property.  Once the active
#     request count drops to the level specified by this property, the
#     service will be 'restarted' based on the values of the
#     'RestartFrequency' and 'RestartIncrement' properties.  To cause the
#     CSM framework to allow subsequent requests to proceed as soon as the
#     active request count drops below level level set by the
#     'MaxRequestCount' property, just set this property to either -1 or 1
#     less than the value of the 'MaxRequestCount' property.
#     The value of this property must be a numeric value.
#     The default value for this property is -1.
# 
# [EntityType].[EntityId].RestartIncrement - This property, along with
#     the 'RestartFrequency' property helps determine how quickly the active
#     request count will rise to the 'maximum request count' whenever a
#     service is 'restarted' after becoming 'flooded'. The
#     'RestartFrequency' property determines how frequenty the permissable
#     number of active requests will be increased.  This property determines
#     how much the permissible number of active requests will increase by
#     whenever it is raised.  If this property is set to a positive value,
#     then the 'RestartFrequency' property must also be set to a positive
#     value.  If this property is set to 0, then the 'RestartFrequency'
#     property must also be set to 0.  In other words, either both
#     properties are 0 or both properties are greater than 0.  When both
#     properties are set to 0, then the permissable number of active
#     requests immediately rises back up to the maximum request count once
#     it has droppedback down to the 'restart threshold'.  When both
#     properties are greater than 0, then the permissable number of active
#     requests gradually rises to the maximum request count.
#     The value of this property must be a numeric value greater than or equal to 0.
#     The default value for this property is 0.
# 
# [EntityType].[EntityId].RestartFrequency - This property, along with
#     the 'RestartIncrement' property helps determine how quickly the active
#     request count will rise to the 'maximum request count' whenever a
#     service is 'restarted' after becoming 'flooded'. The
#     'RestartIncrement' property determines how quickly the permissable
#     number of active requests will be increased.  This property determines
#     how frequently  that increase will occur.  If this property is set to
#     a positive value, then the 'RestartIncrement' property must also be
#     set to a positive value.  If this property is set to 0, then the
#     'RestartIncrement' property must also be set to 0.  In other words,
#     either both properties are 0 or both properties are greater than 0. 
#     When both properties are set to 0, then the permissable number of
#     active requests immediately rises back up to the maximum request count
#     once it has droppedback down to the 'restart threshold'.  When both
#     properties are greater than 0, then the permissable number of active
#     requests gradually rises to the maximum request count.
#     The value of this property must be a numeric value greater than or equal to 0.
#     The default value for this property is 0.
# 
# [EntityType].[EntityId].ServiceGroupId - This property is only
#     relevant for entities that are configured as services (i.e. the
#     [EntityType] portion of the property is set to 'Service').  When the
#     'ServiceGroupId' property is set to a non-blank value, the behavior of
#     the service is controled by the configuration of the corresponding
#     service group.  There is no default value for this property.
# 
# [EntityType].[EntityId].Timeout - the timeout, in milliseconds, for
#     each process that is controlled by this configuration.  Once the
#     duration of a process exceeds this value, the process will be
#     considered to have entered a 'stalled' state.  The default value for
#     this property is 10000.
# 
# FrameworkEnabled: - This is the one property that is not specific to a
#     single entity.  This property determines whether the entire CSM
#     Framework is enabled or disabled.  When disabled, the CSM Framework
#     does not track any process counts.  All requests to access a service
#     are allowed, regardless of the current level of activity.  The value
#     of this property must be either 'true' or 'false'.
# 

#
# Enables the CSM Framework so that it can manage interactions with external
# services and/or resources.  To disable the CSM Framework, simply set
# this property to false.
#
FrameworkEnabled=true

#
# These are the default settings for any service that is no explicitly configured
# below.  A few things to note about this configuration:
#  1) The "Enabled" property is not explicitly set.  Instead, we are relying
#     on the default value of 'true'.
#  2) The Timeout and Type properties are also not explicitly set.  Again, we
#     are relying on the default values for these properties.
#  
Service.DefaultService.Enabled=true
Service.DefaultService.MaxRequestCount=30
Service.DefaultService.MaxStalledRequestCount=20
Service.DefaultService.Timeout=30000
Service.DefaultService.RestartThreshold=-1
Service.DefaultService.AutoPurgeAfter=150000


#
# These are the default settings for any service group that is referenced in 
# a service configuration but not configured below.
# 
# Currently CSI does not use any service group configurations!
#
#Group.DefaultGroup.MaxRequestCount=-1
#Group.DefaultGroup.MaxStalledRequestCount=-1
#Group.DefaultGroup.RestartThreshold=-1
#Group.DefaultGroup.Timeout=-1
