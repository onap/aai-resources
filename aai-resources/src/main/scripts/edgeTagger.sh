# This script is used to synch-up the data in the database with the "edge-tags" definitions found in the  DbEdgeRules.java file.  
# It is not needed during normal operation, but if a new tag (really a property) is defined for an edge or if an
#    existing tag is changed, then this script should be run to migrate existing data so that it matches the new
#    definition.   Note: it is only dealing with the "tags" defined after position 2.  For example, for our existing
#    rules, we have have "isParent" defined in position 2, and then other tags in positions 3, 4 and 5 as 
#    mapped in DbEdgeRules.EdgeInfoMap:
#
#  public static final Map<Integer, String> EdgeInfoMap; 
#    static { 
#        EdgeInfoMap = new HashMap<Integer, String>(); 
#        EdgeInfoMap.put(0, "edgeLabel");
#        EdgeInfoMap.put(1, "direction");
#        EdgeInfoMap.put(2, "isParent" );
#        EdgeInfoMap.put(3, "usesResource" );
#        EdgeInfoMap.put(4, "hasDelTarget" );
#        EdgeInfoMap.put(5, "SVC-INFRA" );
#    }
#  
#   -- The map above is used to interpret the data in the DbEdgeRules.EdgeRules map:
#
#   public static final Multimap<String, String> EdgeRules =
#       new ImmutableSetMultimap.Builder<String, String>() 
#       .putAll("availability-zone|complex","groupsResourcesIn,OUT,false,false,false,reverse")
#       .putAll("availability-zone|service-capability","supportsServiceCapability,OUT,false,false,false,false")
#       .putAll("complex|ctag-pool","hasCtagPool,OUT,true,false,false,false")
#       .putAll("complex|l3-network","usesL3Network,OUT,false,false,false,true")
#       etc...
#
#   -- Valid values for the "tags" can be "true", "false" or "reverse".  Read the T-space
#     write-up for a detailed explanation of this... 
#
#
# To use this script, You can either pass the parameter, "all" to update all the edge rules, or
#   you can pass the KEY to a single edge rule that you would like to update.   NOTE - the 
#   key is that first part of each edge rule that looks like, "nodeTypeA|nodeTypeB".
#
# Ie.   ./edgeTagger.sh "all"
#    or ./edgeTagger.sh "complex|ctag-pool"
