# This script is used to change the cardinality of an existing database property.  
# It currently just allows you to change TO a SET cardinality with dataType = String.
# It does not currently let you preserve the data (since we're just doing this for one
#      field which nobody uses yet).    
#
# Note also - This script just makes changes to the schema that is currently live.
#    If you were to create a new schema in a brandy-new environment, it would look like
#    whatever ex5.json (as of Jan 2016) told it to look like.   So, part of making a 
#    change to the db schema should Always first be to make the change in ex5.json so that
#    future environments will have the change.  This script is just to change existing
#    instances of the schema since schemaGenerator (as of Jan 2016) does not update things - it 
#    just does the initial creation.
#
# Boy, this is getting to be a big comment section...
#
# To use this script, you need to pass four parameters:
#      propertyName    -- the name of the property that you need to change Cardinality on.
#      targetDataType  -- whether it's changing or not, you need to give it:  For now -- we only allow "String"
#      targetCardinality -- For now -- only accepts "SET".   In the future we should support ("SET", "LIST" or "SINGLE")
#      preserveDataFlag -- true or false.     For now -- only supports "false"
#
# Ie.    changePropertyCardinality.sh supplier-release-list String SET false
#
